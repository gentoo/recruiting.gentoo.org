    - ! "## The GLEP workflow\r\nThe GLEP process begins with a new idea for Gentoo
      Linux.  It is highly\r\nrecommended that a single GLEP contain a single key
      proposal or new idea.  The\r\nmore focussed the GLEP, the more successful it
      tends to be.  The GLEP editors\r\nreserve the right to reject GLEP proposals
      if they appear too unfocussed or\r\ntoo broad.  If in doubt, split your GLEP
      into several well-focussed ones.\r\n\r\nEach GLEP must have a champion -- someone
      who writes the GLEP using the style\r\nand format described below, shepherds
      the discussions in the appropriate\r\nforums, and attempts to build community
      consensus around the idea.  The GLEP\r\nchampion (a.k.a. Author) should first
      attempt to ascertain whether the idea is\r\nGLEP-able.  Small enhancements or
      patches often don't need a GLEP and can be\r\ninjected into the Gentoo Linux
      development work flow with an enhancement \"bug\"\r\nsubmitted to the Gentoo
      Linux bugzilla [6].\r\n\r\nThe GLEP champion then emails the GLEP editors <glep@gentoo.org>
      with a\r\nproposed title and a rough, but fleshed out, draft of the GLEP.  This
      draft\r\nmust be written in GLEP style as described below.\r\n\r\nIf the GLEP
      editor accepts the GLEP, he will assign the GLEP a number, label\r\nit as Standards
      Track (a better name would be nice here -- suggestions?) or\r\nInformational,
      give it status \"Draft\", and create and check-in the initial\r\ndraft of the
      GLEP.  The GLEP editors will not unreasonably deny a GLEP.\r\nReasons for denying
      GLEP status include duplication of effort, being\r\ntechnically unsound, not
      providing proper motivation or addressing backwards\r\ncompatibility, or not
      in keeping with Gentoo Linux philosophy.\r\n\r\nIf a pre-GLEP is rejected, the
      author may elect to take the pre-GLEP to the\r\ngentoo-dev@gentoo.org mailing
      list to help flesh it out, gain feedback and\r\nconsensus from the community
      at large, and improve the GLEP for re-submission.\r\n\r\nThe author of the GLEP
      is then responsible for posting the GLEP to the\r\ngentoo-dev mailing list (and
      additionally to the Gentoo Linux forums [7]\r\nif they so desire), and marshaling
      community support for it.  As updates are\r\nnecessary, the GLEP author may
      check in new versions directly, or forward to\r\na Gentoo developer with commit
      access.\r\n\r\nStandards Track GLEPs consist of two parts, a design document
      and a reference\r\nimplementation.  The GLEP should be reviewed and accepted
      before a reference\r\nimplementation is begun, unless a reference implementation
      will aid people in\r\nstudying the GLEP.  Standards Track GLEPs must include
      an implementation -- in\r\nthe form of code, patch, or URL to same -- before
      it can be considered Final.\r\n\r\nGLEP authors are responsible for collecting
      community feedback on a GLEP\r\nbefore submitting it for review.  A GLEP that
      has not been discussed on\r\ngentoo-dev@gentoo.org and the Gentoo Linux forums
      [7] will not be\r\naccepted.  However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions
      on public\r\nmailing lists should be avoided.  Strategies to keep the discussions
      efficient\r\ninclude setting up a specific forums thread for the topic, having
      the GLEP\r\nauthor accept private comments in the early design phases, etc.
      \ GLEP authors\r\nshould use their discretion here.\r\n\r\nOnce the authors
      have completed a GLEP, they must inform the Gentoo Council\r\n[8] that it is
      ready for review by way of the gentoo-dev mailing\r\nlist.  GLEPs are then reviewed
      at a Council meeting where the may be approved\r\nor rejected outright, or sent
      back to the author(s) for revision.  This\r\ngenerally should be done a few
      weeks in advance of the actual review so as to\r\navoid the appearance of \"slipping\"
      a GLEP in without proper public review\r\nby the Gentoo developer community.\r\n\r\n"
